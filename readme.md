# TABS FOR ADMIN & MODERATION MENUS V1.4

[**By Dougiefresh**](http://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?action=profile;u=253913) -> [Link to Mod](http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=3792)

-------

## Introduction
In my opinion, phpBB has a nicer and less confusing layout of the admin menu.  This mod attempts to make the menu closer to phpBB's menu layout without majorly rewriting SMF (also known as forking), as that would be too big a task....

## Admin Alterations
~ Each header has been transformed into an actual tab at the top, underneath the link tree.
~ The sidebar menu has been modified, making all areas of a particular header and all subsections of a particular area, into menu items.
~ The link tree underneath the description has been removed, as the subsections listed are now part of the sidebar.

## Compatibility Notes
This mod was tested on SMF 2.0.9, but should work on SMF 2.1 Beta 1, as well as SMF 2.0 and up.  SMF 1.x is not and will not be supported.
